### about
i decided to make a cute little mood tracker using pixel stars i created! i wanted to practice more javascript, so i decided to develop this simple project. i used pixel art studio on steam to create the stars, as well as html, 
javascript, and css in visual studio code to develop the site. click on the star images under "emotion list" in order to fill track how you're feeling. you can optionally type your thoughts in the text box too.

### challenges / outcomes
i struggled at first with having the blank star image respond to the emotion list's image buttons, but was able to figure it out eventually! i'm planning on developing a game in the future,
so i'd say that being able to learn more about javascript little by little will help me retain more information in the long run.
